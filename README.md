# Movie Trends Visualization using Tableau

This project is a Tableau-based visual storytelling dashboard that explores trends in global movie data using multiple chart types. It provides insights into how movie popularity, ratings, and vote counts have changed over the years.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Visualize top 25 most popular movies
- Show rating trends over time
- Compare rating vs. votes
- Explore how ratings are distributed
- Identify standout movies by year

All visuals are combined into an **interactive dashboard** for easy exploration.

## 📂 Dataset Used

- **Raw Dataset**: `movies.csv`
- **Cleaned Dataset**: `cleaned_movies.csv`
- Fields include: `title`, `year`, `popularity`, `rating`, `vote_count`, `genre`, etc.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Tableau** (`deep new.twb`)
- **Microsoft PowerPoint** (`DEEPTHI PPT.pdf`)
- **Python** (used earlier for data cleaning if applicable)

## 💡 Key Findings

| Expectation                  | Reality (Surprise)                                  |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Recent movies = more popular | Some have very low ratings                         |
| Ratings should improve       | Ratings are actually declining                     |
| More votes = higher quality  | Some low-vote films are critically acclaimed       |
| Ratings vary widely          | Most fall between 6.5–7.5                          |
| Every year has a hit         | A few years had no clear standout movie            |
